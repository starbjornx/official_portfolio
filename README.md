# Extra

## Personal

Welcome! You have made it this far and may be wondering, who is Kyle? Well thanks for askin! First and most important... I am a father, I have two wonder children ages 12 and 10 (as of this year 2022.). I struggle daily with the loss of my father, the grief is overwhelming and I try my best every day to put on a happy smile and make each day count! Thats why, age 35 (soon to be 36 as of 2022.) I decided to change my career path in life and go away from a public figure for youth football in the community of Las Vegas NV. I find a passion for what I do now, I really want to leave an imprint of who I am so that maybe one day in the future my grandkids will see this and get a understanding of who I am. I want to leave something behind when I pass on from this life I think that the internet is a pretty solid digital footprint in our reality.

## Hobies
